I am a Software Engineer with professional experience with a wide rage of technologies such as Backend engineering, Fullstack engineering and DevOps. I have worked with JavaScript(node.js), Python, Go and more. Currently I focus on how to solve real-world problems with Software and the way of automating everything around md as well!

### My Principles

> Here's principles I keep in mind

* think from an end-user perspective
* think "why" and "how"
* understand people make mistakes
* write a document and share it whenever I write code
* work together
* learn from everything and everyone

### Software Development Principles I Like

* **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It
* **KISS**: Keep It Simple Stupid!
* Measure Twice and Cut Once
* **DRY**: Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself
